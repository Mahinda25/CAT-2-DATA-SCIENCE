election strategy 
develop a predictive model that can identify and classify voters based on their online behavior and social media interactions. the model should be able to predict the likelihood of a voter supporting a particular candidate in an election. 
data
large dataset of Facebook , twitter, Instagram
voter registration data
questions to guide you develop the model:
1. which type of machine learning algorithm would be most suitable for this task? explain your reasoning.
2. what features from the social media data would be most relevant for predicting voter sentiment ?
3. how can you ensure that your model is unbiased and does not discriminate against any particular group of voters?
4. how can you evaluate the performance of your model and make sure it is accurate
